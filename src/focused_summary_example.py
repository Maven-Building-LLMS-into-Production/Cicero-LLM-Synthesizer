that you eventually run out of other peoples moneypp2 do you know that one of the great problems of our age is that we are governed by people who care more about feelings than they do about thoughts and deaspp3 i think weve been through a period where too many people have been given to understand that if they have a problem its the governments job to cope with it i have a problem ill get a grant im homeless the government must house me theyre casting their problem on society and you know there is no such thing as society there are individual men and women and there are families and no government can do anything except through people and people must look to themselves first its our duty to look after ourselves and then also to look after our neighbor people have got the too much in mind without the obligations theres no such thing as entitlement unless someone has first met an obligationpp4 no one would remember the good samaritan if hed only had good intentions he had money as wellpp5 the philosophical reason for which we are against nationalization and for private enterprise is because we believe that economic progress comes from the inventiveness ability determination and the pioneering spirit of extraordinary men and women if they cannot exercise that spirit here they will go away to another free enterprise country which will then make more economic progress than we do we ought in fact to be encouraging small firms and small companies because the extent to which innovation comes through these companies is endouspp6 our challenge is to create the kind of economic background which enables private initiative and private enterprise to flourish for the benefit of the consumer employee the pensioner and society as a believe we should judge people on merit and not on background i believe the person who is prepared to work hardest should get the greatest rewards and keep them after tax that we should back the workers and not the shirkers that it is not only permissible but praiseworthy to want to benefit your own family by your own effortspp7 i place a profound eliefindeed a fervent faithin the virtues of elfreliance and personal independence on these is founded the whole case for the free society for the assertion that human progress is best achieved by offering the freest possible scope for the development of individual talents qualified only by a respect for the qualities and the freedom of othersfor many years there has been a subtle erosion of the essential virtues of the free society elfreliance has been sneered at as if it were an absurd suburban pretention thrift has been denigrated as if it were greed the desire of parents to choose and to struggle for what they themselves regarded as the best possible education for their children has been cornedpp8 what are the lessons then that weve learned from the last thirty years first that the pursuit of equality itself is a mirage whats more desirable and more practicable than the pursuit of equality is the pursuit of equality of opportunity and opportunity means nothing unless it includes the right to be unequal and the freedom to be different one of the reasons that we value individuals is not because theyre all the same but because theyre all different i believe you have a saying in the middle west dont cut down the tall poppies let them rather grow tall i would say let our children grow tall and some taller than others if they have the ability in them to do so because we must build a society in which each citizen can develop his full potential both for his own benefit and for the community as a whole a society in which originality skill energy and thrift are rewarded in which we encourage rather than restrict the variety and richness of human naturepp9 some socialists seem to believe that people should be numbers in a state computer we believe they should be individuals we are all unequal no one thank heavens is like anyone else however much the socialists may pretend otherwise we believe that everyone has the right to be unequal but to us every human being is equally mportantpp10 there is no such thing as safe socialism if its safe its not socialism and if its socialism its not safe the signposts of socialism point downhill to less freedom less prosperity downhill to more muddle more failure if we follow them to their destination they
